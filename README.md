# Extractive Text Summarization
This repository provides an implementation of extractive text summarization using the "sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6" model. The model is based on the DistilBART architecture, which is a smaller and faster version of BART, a state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model for natural language processing. The implementation can be used to summarize any text data such as news articles, research papers, and more.




## How to use

1. Clone the repository.
2. And run this extractive-text-summarization.ipynb file in Google Colab.

## Limitations

Extractive text summarization has its limitations. The summarization algorithm is only as good as the quality of the input text. It is recommended to clean and preprocess the text data before running the summarization algorithm. Additionally, the algorithm may not be able to identify the most important sentences in some cases, and the summary may not accurately represent the original text.
